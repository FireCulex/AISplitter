# AISplitter
Very not simple AutoSplitter script for Livesplit with additional features.

## Getting Started
We use the in-game Auto-Save Mission Name for Starts and Splits. Load removal is based on the swirly icon. There's also Cinematics and Pause removers. Each setting can be enabled or disabled.
