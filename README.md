# AISplitter
Very simple AutoSplitter script for Livesplit with splits.

## Getting Started
We use the in-game Mission counter. Has nothing to do with loading screens.

Recommend using the existing Load Remover as Mission counter happens at the start of a mission as opposed to load.

### Prerequisites
* Livesplit 1.7.6
* Layout -> Scriptable Auto Splitter -> Script Path -> location of the AI autosplit asl

## TODO:
* Automatically start timer
* Automatically end timer
* Pause screen also pauses timer
