# AISplitter
Very simple AutoSplitter script for Livesplit with splits and subsplits.

## Getting Started
We keep existing Mission splits and use the loading screens as hidden subsplits.

This will split and pause the timer during until loading the next area is complete. 

It splits on the next area load, previous area load, Previous Save, specific Mission Save, but not Current Save. 

### Prerequisites
* Livesplit 1.7.6
* Layout -> Scriptable Auto Splitter -> Script Path -> location of the AI autosplit asl
* Subsplits list in layout, not Splits
* Layout -> Subsplits -> Contextual

## TODO:
* Automatically start timer
* Automatically end timer
* Pause screen also pauses timer
